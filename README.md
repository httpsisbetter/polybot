# polybot
Basic open source version of the Poly C2 bot


---
## Tut.
1. Firstly open up the ```main.py``` file and change the token and server/node name to your liking
The first line automatically installs py-cord for you but I commented it, if you want to install it the first time you run the bot then re comment it you can do that too

2. Then if you havent already install the latest python onto your machine found here ```https://www.python.org/downloads/```

3. After step 2 run the req.bat to automatically install all the prereqs that are required to running the bot

4. Then youre finished, if youre on linux just make a tmux session and do python main.py but if youre on a windows or any else double-click/run the run.bat file
